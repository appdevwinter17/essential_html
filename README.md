# Essential HTML

Read through `details.html`, `index.html`, and `new.html` and try to make sense of them. Open them in Chrome and play with them. Click on things. Experiment.

Ask a question about anything at all in them that seems fuzzy.

Bootstrap and everything else are fun, but this is all you **need** to know for now about how HTML works.
